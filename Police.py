### Problem Statement            
Traditional police logbooks are **paper-based**, making them difficult to manage, search, and analyze.  
They often lack real-time accessibility, transparency, and efficiency in operations.

### Objective          
    ✅ To digitize police logs for better record-keeping, transparency, and analytics.
    ✅ To provide an interactive dashboard for monitoring reports and officer activities.
    ✅ To ensure secure, efficient, and scalable data management.
    ✅ Query-powered dashboards for law enforcement
            
### Why Digital Logs?
- Faster access to records 🔎  
- Reduced paperwork 📚  
- Improved accountability ✅  
- Easy tracking of case progress 🚨  
- Data-driven decision making 📈
