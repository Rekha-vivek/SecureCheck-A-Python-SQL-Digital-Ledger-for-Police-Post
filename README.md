# 🚔 SecureCheck — A Python-SQL Digital Ledger for Police Post

### 📖 Overview
**SecureCheck** is a digital record-keeping system built using **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Pandas**.  
It helps police posts maintain daily logs of **traffic stops, arrests, and violations** securely and efficiently.  
Instead of traditional paper registers, SecureCheck provides a **modern SQL-based digital ledger** — making it easier to store, query, and analyze data.

## ⚙️ Features
- 🗃️ Store and retrieve police data (traffic stops, driver details, violations)
- 🔍 Filter and analyze records using SQL queries
- 📊 Generate insights such as:
  - Most common violations  
  - Arrest rate by age group  
  - Average stop duration by violation type  
  - Drug-related stop statistics  
- 🧠 Built using **Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy** for smooth data handling
- 🔒 Secure connection with PostgreSQL database

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rekha-vivek/SecureCheck-A-Python-SQL-Digital-Ledger-for-Police-Post.git
cd SecureCheck-A-Python-SQL-Digital-Ledger-for-Police-Post
```

###2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas psycopg2 sqlalchemy streamlit
```

### 3️⃣ Configure the Database Connection
```python
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",
    database="securecheck_traffic",
    user="postgres",
    password="your_password",
    port="5432"
)
```
### 4️⃣ Run the Code
You can run the project in two ways:

- **Jupyter Notebook:**  
  Open and execute `Police.ipynb`

- **Python Script:**  
  ```bash
  python Police.py
  
## 🧡 **PART 5 — SQL Queries Used** 

```markdown

## 🧮 SQL Queries Used

```sql
-- 1. Count total number of traffic stops
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM traffic_stops;

-- 2. Highest arrest rate by driver age
SELECT driver_age,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN is_arrested=TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::DECIMAL / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS arrest_rate
FROM traffic_stops
WHERE driver_age > 0
GROUP BY driver_age
ORDER BY arrest_rate DESC;

-- 3. Average stop duration by violation
SELECT violation,
       AVG(CASE 
             WHEN stop_duration='0-15 Min' THEN 7.5
             WHEN stop_duration='16-30 Min' THEN 23
             WHEN stop_duration='30+ Min' THEN 45 
           END) AS avg_stop_duration
FROM traffic_stops
GROUP BY violation
ORDER BY avg_stop_duration DESC;

-- 4. Top vehicles involved in drug-related stops
SELECT vehicle_number, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM traffic_stops
WHERE drugs_related_stop = TRUE
GROUP BY vehicle_number
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## 🧩 Key Python Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| `creating_connection()` | Connects Python to the PostgreSQL database |
| `fetching_of_data(query)` | Executes SQL queries and returns results as a Pandas DataFrame |
| `pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)` | Reads SQL queries directly into Pandas |
| `create_engine()` | Creates an SQLAlchemy connection engine for smoother integration |

## 📊 Example Outputs

| driver_age | total_stops | total_arrests | arrest_rate |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| 30 | 52 | 22 | 42.31% |
| 25 | 45 | 10 | 22.22% |
| 19 | 10 | 3 | 30.00% |

| violation | avg_stop_duration |
|------------|-------------------|
| DUI | 45.00 |
| Speeding | 23.00 |
| No Seatbelt | 7.50 |
